#### Lesson Summary:

This lesson summarizes student's knowledge of AB Testing, asking them to brainstorm a scenario in which they might implement a hypothesis test. From there, student's are asked to design and experiment, and make up hypothetical results to then interpret. Finally, they are also asked to present these findings to a nontechnical stakeholder. The lesson is designed to be interactive, asking students to follow the think-pair-share framework.

#### Topic:

Statistics: AB Testing


#### Prerequisite knowledge:

Students should have a solid understanding of hypothesis testing before engaging with this lesson. They should have performed a number of scaffolded examples and exercises concerning writing null/alternative hypothesese, interpreting effect size and power and working with z-scores and t-scores.

#### Prequisite Learn-Materials:

Students should have previously completed sections 18-21 and
[AB Testing](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-ab-testing) from Section 22.
